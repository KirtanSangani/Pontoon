# Pontoon
In this project, I created a simulated version of the card game "Black Jack" between two people, the dealer and player. This version of BlackJack is also called "Pontoon" which is a more difficult version with more rules. 

Pontoon is the British version of the game with a slight twist on the rules. 
* 1 - 7 Players can join the game
* Each player starts with $100
* Each player automatically bets $10 go start the round
* Each player and dealer gets two cards
    * The Dealer's first two cards are hidden until all players finish their turns
* If you get BlackJack, your payout is 1.5x the bet
* If you choose to draw 5 cards, if you do not go over 21, you automatically win
    * Your payout is 2x the bet
* If you bust, then the dealer automatically wins
